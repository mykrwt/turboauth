# TurboAuth Configuration File
# Version: 1.0.0
# Description: Lightweight, visually polished authentication plugin
# ====================================================================

# Authentication spawn location where players will be teleported
# to authenticate before they can play normally
auth-spawn:
  world: "world"           # World name where auth spawn is located
  x: 0.0                   # X coordinate
  y: 64.0                  # Y coordinate (ground level)
  z: 0.0                   # Z coordinate
  yaw: 0.0                 # Player facing direction (0 = south)
  pitch: 0.0               # Player looking up/down angle

# Fallback spawn location used when original player location
# cannot be restored (e.g., world doesn't exist, unsafe location)
fallback-spawn:
  world: "world"           # World name where fallback spawn is located
  x: 0.0                   # X coordinate
  y: 64.0                  # Y coordinate
  z: 0.0                   # Z coordinate
  yaw: 0.0                 # Player facing direction
  pitch: 0.0               # Player looking angle

# ====================================================================
# Usage Instructions:
# ====================================================================
# 1. Configure auth-spawn to a safe location where players will
#    authenticate (recommended: separate authentication world)
#
# 2. Configure fallback-spawn for post-authentication teleport
#    (recommended: server spawn or safe location)
#
# 3. Customize messages to match your server theme
#
# 4. Adjust security settings based on your needs
#
# 5. Enable/disable animations and sounds as desired
#
# 6. Use /turboauth setspawn and /turboauth setfallback
#    to easily configure spawn locations in-game
#
# 7. Restart server or use /turboauth reload after changes
#
# For advanced users: Supports MiniMessage format for rich text
# Examples: <bold>, <italic>, <rainbow>, <gradient:#FF0000:#00FF00>
